# Mangadex Heroku

Using [mangadex-api v4](https://github.com/ejnshtein/mangadex-api).

Right now this app is working as GraphQL endpoint for [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org) platform.

Playground located [here](http://mangadex.herokuapp.com/graphql).

Note that some requests can take a long time to execute due to n+1 nesting.
